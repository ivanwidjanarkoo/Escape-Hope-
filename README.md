# Escape-Hope-
This project was created for my Introduction to Programming class. I was tasked specifically with using the GUIZero interface for animation and design. The basic idea of this mini-game is to "Escape Hope" (the rival school of Calvin University). In which, once you successfully escape Hope, the levels will get harder and more obstacles appear.
